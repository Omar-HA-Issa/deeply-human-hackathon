**WorldQuest** is a globe-spanning quiz adventure where learning geography becomes a game of exploration, mastery, and social play. This project was built for **Deeply Human**—a community and mission we love—because we believe playful learning is a powerful path to curiosity, empathy, and *greater consciousness*. WorldQuest turns facts into felt understanding: every country you unlock is a little more awareness of our shared planet.

## Why this exists (Deeply Human)![Uploading worldquestfrontend.png…]()

We built WorldQuest for **Deeply Human** to help people grow consciousness through play, curiosity, and connection. The experience is intentionally designed to encourage:
- **Presence**: slow down and learn, one country at a time.
- **Perspective**: understand place, people, and context beyond your own.
- **Connection**: challenge friends and celebrate progress together.

This is more than trivia—it's a ritual of learning and shared discovery.
