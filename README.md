# WorldQuest 🌍✨<img width="1241" height="732" alt="worldquestfrontend" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/792de25a-0179-42e7-bfd7-d465d5525b6b" />


**WorldQuest** is a globe-spanning quiz adventure where learning geography becomes a game of exploration, mastery, and social play. This project was built for **Deeply Human**—a community and mission we love—because we believe playful learning is a powerful path to curiosity, empathy, and *greater consciousness*. WorldQuest turns facts into felt understanding: every country you unlock is a little more awareness of our shared planet.

## Why this exists (Deeply Human)!

We built WorldQuest for **Deeply Human** to help people grow consciousness through play, curiosity, and connection. The experience is intentionally designed to encourage:
- **Presence**: slow down and learn, one country at a time.
- **Perspective**: understand place, people, and context beyond your own.
- **Connection**: challenge friends and celebrate progress together.

This is more than trivia—it's a ritual of learning and shared discovery.

## What you can do
### Core experience
- **Explore the world on a 3D globe** and select countries to quiz.
- **Answer curated quiz questions** that mix core facts with surprising insights.
- **Earn XP and points** for accuracy and speed.
- **Unlock countries progressively** by completing quizzes, following the map’s adjacency rules.

### Social play
- **Add friends and send challenges** in any country.
- **Compete in friend matches** and compare results.
- **Celebrate streaks and progress** through shared activity.

> Friend matches are designed for play without breaking progression rules—you can challenge friends anywhere without unlocking countries you haven't earned yet.
